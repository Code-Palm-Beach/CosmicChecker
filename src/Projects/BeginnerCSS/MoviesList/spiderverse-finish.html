          <h1 class="title">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse.</h1>
          <a href="/" class="button">Back Home</a>
          <p>
            Teenager Miles Morales struggles to live up to the expectations of his father, police officer Jefferson
            Davis, who sees Spider-Man as a menace. Miles transfers to a boarding school, but later sneaks out and goes
            to his uncle Aaron Davis' apartment. When he takes Miles to an abandoned subway station to paint graffiti,
            Miles is bitten by a radioactive spider and gains spider-like abilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Miles returns to the station to search for the spider and discovers a particle accelerator called "The
            Super-Collider" built by Kingpin, who hopes to access parallel universes. Miles notices Spider-Man has
            arrived and is attempting to disable the collider while fighting Kingpin's enforcers, Green Goblin and
            Prowler. Spider-Man saves Miles and Green Goblin shoves Spider-Man into the collider and causes an explosion
            that nearly kills him. Wounded, Spider-Man gives Miles a USB drive that will disable the accelerator and
            warns that the machine could destroy the city if reactivated. Miles watches in horror as Kingpin kills
            Spider-Man, before fleeing from Prowler.
          </p>

          <p>
            Miles tries out his newfound abilities in a Spider-Man costume, but damages the USB drive after falling off
            a building. At Spider-Man's grave, Miles meets Peter B. Parker, an older and worn-down version of Spider-Man
            from another dimension. Miles inadvertently discovers a power to emit a bio-electric "venom" blast to stun
            and disable his victim. Peter reluctantly agrees to train Miles in exchange for help stealing data to create
            a new drive. In Fisk's research facility, Miles discovers he also has the power to turn invisible. They are
            confronted by scientist Olivia Octavius, who takes DNA samples from Peter and reveals that he will die due
            to cellular decay if he stays in their dimension too long.
          </p>

          <p>
            Miles and Peter are rescued by Gwen Stacy, Spider-Woman from another dimension. Meanwhile, Kingpin's
            motivations for creating the collider are revealed: to find alternate versions of his deceased wife and son,
            who died in a car crash. The group find Peter's aunt, May Parker, who is sheltering more heroes from other
            dimensions—Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Ham, and Peni Parker—who are also deteriorating. Miles offers to disable
            the collider so the others can return home, but the heroes tell him he lacks experience. Miles retreats to
            Aaron's home where he discovers that Aaron is the Prowler. He returns to May's house where Peni has
            completed the drive; however, he is followed by Kingpin, Prowler, Octavius, Scorpion, and Tombstone, leading
            to a brawl. Miles flees, but is captured by Aaron and unmasks himself. Unwilling to kill Miles, Aaron is
            mortally shot by Fisk. Miles flees with Aaron, but Aaron dies of his injuries. Jefferson sees Miles mourning
            over Aaron and concludes that Spider-Man killed him.
          </p>

          <p>
            The heroes regroup with Miles in his dorm. Peter restrains Miles with his webs to ensure his safety before
            heading out with the heroes, choosing to sacrifice himself by staying behind and deactivating the collider.
            Jefferson arrives outside Miles' door and, assuming he does not want to speak to him, apologizes for his
            mistakes. Miles masters his powers and goes to Aunt May's where he gains web shooters and repaints Peter's
            suit. He joins the heroes and helps them defeat Kingpin's enforcers before activating the USB drive and
            sending them home. Kingpin and Miles fight throughout the collider, attracting Jefferson's attention. As
            Miles is nearly killed, Jefferson realizes that Spider-Man is not the enemy and encourages him. Miles
            paralyzes Kingpin with his venom blast and throws him at the kill switch, destroying the collider.
          </p>

          <p>
            Kingpin and his enforcers are arrested and Jefferson recognizes Spider-Man as a hero. Miles embraces the
            responsibilities of his new life. Back in their home dimensions, the heroes return to their lives; Peter
            prepares to fix his relationship with Mary Jane, and Gwen finds a way to contact Miles across dimensions.
          </p>

          <p>
            In another dimension, Miguel O'Hara (Spider-Man 2099) travels to a 1967 New York and argues with the
            Spider-Man there.
